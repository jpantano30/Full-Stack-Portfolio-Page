  "bio": "Hello! I'm Jena, a Software Engineer. My passion lies at the intersection of technology and health/fitness, where I am committed to developing innovative solutions that enhance the health and fitness industry. My varied background spans health and fitness, culinary arts, and public health, providing me with a holistic perspective that influences my approach to technology.Outside of coding, I am a dog lover and a fitness enthusiast. After discovering my love for CrossFit five years ago, I now coach to inspire others in their fitness journeys. My culinary adventures led me to a career as a baker and pastry chef before the deciding to switch to software development. I've studied at Boston University, pursued psychology, and ventured into culinary school, always with the goal of making a positive impact in everything I do. You can often find me at the local CrossFit gym with my dog, Paisley, or experimenting in the kitchen, transforming classic dishes into nutritious yet delicious meals. Whether I'm coding or whipping up a purple sweet potato crust pizza, I bring creativity, empathy, and a relentless drive to all my endeavors."
